        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I'm an assistant band director that teaches fifth through twelfth grade students.  While I have a bachelors degree in Music Education, I feel that my calling is to pursue front-end web development.</p>
        <p>Twelve years ago I started to learn how to design websites using frames and basic hypertext.  Since then I have learned Joomla and website customization through not only modifying stylesheets but also changing template and module scripts.  For the last four years I have honed my Joomla experiences to guide me to taking a direct approach to writing website code.</p>

      <div class="card">
        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I want to continue to grow in my own abilities to not only be more familiar with the coding aspect but to meld an aesthetic that is pleasing to the eye.  Accomplishing this task will require me to review certain skills and learn new ones along the way.  Javascript is my weakest area in web development, but I am working on molding a comfort and ability to write code.</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I'd like to work full-time near the Dallas/Metroplex area not only because of the number of opportunities but to also move closer to family.</p>

        <h2>Business Philosophy</h2>
        <p>The experience of being an educator lends me to see a different perspective than other web developers.  I have delt with parents and students that push boundaries, and those that need to be constantly reassured.  Communication is a necessity whether it comes from a business or personal perspective.  Just like those students, clients need to feel like you understand their needs and give them the attention they deserve.  Trust is built and fostered through continued collaboration for the best possible product.</p>
        <p>You should ask yourself if you need someone that has been in the public education system and knows how to foster a positive working relationship with not only coworkers but clients.</p>
